# UpcomingMovies

Simple app that shows a list of upcoming movies with a detail screen and also have a movie search.
Multi language support (Currently supports "en" an "ptBR").
Made using [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en).

## Installation
Just to make it easier, I've chosen to add Pods directory to the repo, so you don't need to have cocoapods installed nor run pod install

- Open `UpcomingMovies.xcworkspace`
- Build & run.
